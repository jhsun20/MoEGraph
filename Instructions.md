# Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) for Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Generalization in Graph Learning

**Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

---

## 1. Objective

To develop and evaluate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that improves Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization in graph learning tasks, with an initial emphasis on graph classification. The goal is to outperform current state-of-the-art methods on standard OOD benchmarks by leveraging expert diversity and dynamic aggregation.

## 2. Background and Motivation

OOD generalization is a central challenge in graph-based machine learning. Traditional solutions often rely on data augmentation, domain-invariant learning, or robust optimization. MoE architectures offer a promising alternative by introducing modular specialization and conditional computation. Building on insights from models like GraphMETRO, our work aims to extend this direction through:

* Learned or diversity-promoting expert behaviors
* Improved aggregation mechanisms
* Training strategies that enhance generalization

## 3. Proposed Features

> **Implementation Note:** All core components and experimental options should be configurable via a `config.yaml` file or command-line interface (CLI) using `argparse`. This enables high flexibility, simplifies experimentation, and supports automated ablation studies. For example:
>
> * Switch between GIN and GCN by modifying one line in the config
> * Toggle data augmentation on or off
> * Set the number of experts (e.g., 1 to 4)
> * Choose gating and aggregation strategies

### 3.1 Core Components

* **Data Augmentation Module:** A modular component for applying graph augmentations (e.g., node feature masking, edge perturbation, subgraph sampling). Supports both static and learned augmentation strategies.
* **Backbone GNN Encoder:** Shared or per-expert GNNs (e.g., GIN, GCN, GraphSAGE) implemented in PyTorch Geometric.
* **Expert Modules:** Multiple experts generate diverse graph embeddings.
* **Gating Mechanism:** Computes expert weights during inference (e.g., soft attention, learned voting).
* **Expert Aggregation:** Combines expert outputs using strategies such as weighted averaging, ensemble voting, or contrastive agreement.
* **Modular Design:** The codebase is designed for modularity, allowing parameter-level control over each component. This makes it easy to toggle components (e.g., enabling/disabling augmentation, adjusting the number of experts) and supports systematic ablation.

### 3.2 Novel Extensions

* **Learned Graph Augmentation Module:** Trains a policy to produce "hard" augmentations that stress OOD generalization.
* **Expert-Specific Augmentations:** Each expert has its own augmentation process, either fixed or learned. This introduces distinct views of the graph per expert and encourages specialization. This is a key novel contribution.
* **Unconstrained Expert Specialization:** Encourages expert diversity through loss regularization (e.g., orthogonality, disagreement) without requiring fixed expert-task mappings.
* **Meta-Regularization:** Incorporates contrastive learning or mutual information surrogates to promote invariant or complementary representations.

## 4. Datasets and Benchmarks

* **Primary Focus:**

  * Graph classification using the GOOD Benchmark (Graph Out-Of-Distribution benchmark)
  * Includes molecule datasets (e.g., BBBP, Tox21) and social datasets (e.g., Twitch, Amazon)

* **Baseline Alignment:**

  * Use the same base architectures as the GOOD benchmark (e.g., GIN, GCN in PyTorch Geometric) to ensure fair comparisons
  * Enable all architecture and training configuration via `config.yaml` or CLI for reproducibility

---

## 5. Evaluation Criteria

* OOD performance vs. in-distribution performance
* Expert diversity metrics (e.g., cosine distance, prediction variance)
* Ablation studies on aggregation, augmentation, expert count, and gating
* Visualizations (e.g., t-SNE embeddings, gate usage distributions)

---

## 6. Experiment Process

The model will be developed incrementally to isolate the effects of each component through a sequence of structured experiments:

1. **Baseline GNN:**

   * Train a single GNN (e.g., GIN or GCN) without MoE or augmentation
   * Establish performance baseline on the GOOD benchmark

2. **Basic MoE:**

   * Introduce multiple experts and a simple aggregation mechanism
   * No data augmentation or regularization applied

3. **Expert Diversity Induction:**

   * Add regularization terms to encourage expert diversity (e.g., orthogonality, disagreement)

4. **Data Augmentation:**

   * First, integrate a shared data augmentation module
   * Then introduce expert-specific augmentation pipelines

5. **Meta-Regularization and Invariance:**

   * Apply contrastive learning or information-maximizing regularizers

6. **Full Model:**

   * Combine all components: expert-specific augmentation, gating, aggregation, and regularization

Each phase will be evaluated using the same metrics and datasets to support clear comparison and ensure meaningful ablation.

## 7. Risks and Mitigations

* **Expert Collapse:**

  * Use diversity-promoting regularization (e.g., orthogonality losses)
* **Training Instability:**

  * Apply warm-up schedules and gate regularization
* **Computational Overhead:**

  * Use shared encoders and efficient routing within the MoE framework
* **Engineering Complexity:**

  * Design system to be parameter-driven using structured config files and CLI options
